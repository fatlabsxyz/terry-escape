To add background music:

1. Add an audio file named "balatro.mp3" or "balatro.ogg" to this directory
2. The music will automatically play when joining the game
3. Users can toggle music on/off with the music button in the bottom right

The music volume is set to 30% by default to not overpower game sounds.
